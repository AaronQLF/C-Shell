# Custom Shell in C

Welcome to the Custom Shell project! This README file provides an overview of the project, instructions for installation, details on usage, key features, contribution guidelines, licensing information, and credits.

## Introduction

The Custom Shell project aims to develop a fully functional shell program implemented in C, providing a command-line interface for users to interact with their operating system. This custom shell includes essential features found in traditional Unix shells, along with additional functionalities for improved user experience and efficiency.

## Installation

To install the custom shell, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code:
   ```
   cd custom-shell
   ```

3. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```
   gcc -o custom-shell custom-shell.c
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./custom-shell
   ```

## Usage

Once the custom shell is running, you can start entering commands. Here are some examples of commands you can use:

- `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd <directory>`: Change the current directory.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `echo <message>`: Display a message.
- `mkdir <directory>`: Create a new directory.
- `rm <file>`: Remove a file.

For more information on command syntax and options, refer to the Features section below.

## Features

1. **Command Execution:** Execute system commands entered by the user.
2. **Built-in Commands:** Implement common shell commands directly within the shell.
3. **Input/Output Redirection:** Redirect input and output of commands to and from files.
4. **Piping:** Chain multiple commands together by piping output as input.
5. **Background Processes:** Run commands in the background.
6. **Signal Handling:** Handle signals such as Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Z.
7. **Tab Completion:** Assist users with command typing by suggesting completions.
8. **History:** Log previously executed commands for retrieval and rerunning.
9. **Customization:** Customize shell environment settings, aliases, prompt, and functions.
